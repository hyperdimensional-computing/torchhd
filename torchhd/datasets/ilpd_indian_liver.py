    Args:
        root (string): Root directory containing the files of the dataset.
        train (bool, optional): If True, returns training (sub)set from the file storing training data as further determined by fold and hyper_search variables.
            Otherwise returns a subset of train dataset if hypersearch is performed (``hyper_search = True``) if not (``hyper_search = False``) returns a subset of training dataset
            as specified in ``conxuntos_kfold.dat`` if fold number is correct. Otherwise issues an error.
        fold (int, optional): Specifies which fold number to use. The default value of -1 returns all the training data from the corresponding file.
            Values between 0 and 3 specify, which fold in ``conxuntos_kfold.dat`` to use. Relevant only if hyper_search is set to False and ``0 <= fold <= 3``.
            Indices in even rows (zero indexing) of ``conxuntos_kfold.dat`` correspond to train subsets while indices in odd rows correspond to test subsets.
        hyper_search (bool, optional): If True, creates dataset using indeces in ``conxuntos.dat``. This split is used for hyperparameter search. The first row corresponds to train indices (used if ``train = True``)
            while the second row corresponds to test indices (used if ``train = False``).
        transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in an torch.FloatTensor
            and returns a transformed version.
        target_transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in the
            target and transforms it.
        download (bool, optional): If True, downloads the dataset from the internet and
            puts it in root directory. If dataset is already downloaded, it is not
            downloaded again.
