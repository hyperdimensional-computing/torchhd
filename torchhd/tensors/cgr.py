    r"""Cyclic Group Representation (CGR)

    First introduced in `Modular Composite Representation <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12559-013-9243-y>`_ and then better elaborated in `Understanding hyperdimensional computing for parallel single-pass learning <https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/080be5eb7e887319ff30c792c2cbc28c-Paper-Conference.pdf>`_, this model works with modular integer vectors. It works similar to the MCR class, but uses a bundling based on element-wise mode instead of addition of complex numbers.

    def bundle(self, other: "CGRTensor") -> "CGRTensor":
        r"""Bundle the hypervector with majority voting. Ties might be broken at random. However, the expected result is that the tie representing the lowest value wins.

        This produces a hypervector maximally similar to both.

        The bundling operation is used to aggregate information into a single hypervector.

        Args:
            other (CGR): other input hypervector

        Shapes:
            - Self: :math:`(*)`
            - Other: :math:`(*)`
            - Output: :math:`(*)`

        Examples::

            >>> a, b = torchhd.CGRTensor.random(2, 10, block_size=64)
            >>> a
